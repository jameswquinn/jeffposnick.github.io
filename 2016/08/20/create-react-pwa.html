It’s a project that came out of Facebook’s React engineering a few months back, and has since gained some significant mindshare in the web developer community.</p><h1 id="and-its-limitations">…and it’s limitations</h1><p>In keeping with the fewer-depencies-are-better-dependencies philosophy behind <code class="highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code>, the maintainers <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/192">appear to be vigilant</a> in the fight against scope creep, and are keeping the project lean. That’s understandable, and it’s left up to end users to decide what additional functionality to layer on top of the project’s skeleton.</p><p>By design, the core of the build process isn’t directly extensible. It’s kicked off by <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run build</code> and consists of</p><div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>"scripts": {
 "build": "react-scripts build"
}
</code></pre></div><p>But! The opportunity’s there to cleanly chain some additional commands after that initial <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-scripts build</code>, while keeping the <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-scripts</code> black box opaque, giving us the chance to modify the output of the original build process.</p><h1 id="an-opportunity-for-pwa-ification">An Opportunity for PWA-ification</h1><p>That gets to the heart of my investigation: what’s the easiest way to guide developers starting from a fresh <code class="highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> towards the end goal of deploying a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">progressive web app</a>? Specifically, what would it take to add in a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-worker/">service worker</a> that provided performance benefits as well as a meaningful offline experience, as well as a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android">web app manifest</a> that contained application metadata?</p><h2 id="adding-a-web-app-manifest">Adding a Web App Manifest</h2><p>This is just a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">standard</a> JSON file with fields containing metadata useful for controlling the “add to homescreen” experience (currently only on Android devices). While each developer needs to choose their metadata wisely, there’s nothing particularly challenging here from a technical perspective, and we just need to create the file and get it copied over to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">build/</code> output directory as part of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run build</code> process.</p><h2 id="adding-a-service-worker">Adding a Service Worker</h2><p>To handle the service worker, I (not surprisingly) turned to the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache"><code class="highlighter-rouge">sw-precache</code></a> project. When added to a build process, it generates a service worker JavaScript file that will automatically version and keep all local static files—HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.—up to date. Because <em>all</em> of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> output is local static files (there’s no server-side rendering or remote API calls by default, for example), <code class="highlighter-rouge">sw-precache</code> can handle everything we need with little configuration needed.</p><p>While I’ve traditionally used <code class="highlighter-rouge">sw-precache</code> as a JavaScript module inside of a <a href="http://gulpjs.com/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">gulp</code> build</a> process, it also sports a <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#command-line-interface">command-line interface</a>, and it’s simple to add in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sw-precache</code> command to the end of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run build</code> script chain.</p><h2 id="the-user-experience">The User Experience</h2><p>Here’s what the deployed PWA looks like on Chrome for Android, going through the steps of accepting the Add to Homescreen banner, and then launching it without a network connection.</p><iframe width="271" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nV8sKoVbD5Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h1 id="try-it-yourself">Try it Yourself</h1><p>The best way to visualize the changes to the build process, as well as the (small) modifications needed to the source code, is to view the <a href="https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa/compare/starting-point...pwa">GitHub diff</a> between the starting point and the “final” PWA.</p><p>Take “final” with a grain of salt, because while you will end up with a build process that yields a progressive web app, there are many directions you might want to take the starter project, and some of those might entail a more complex service worker implementation. I’ve tried to cover <a href="https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa#what-additional-changes-might-be-needed">some scenarios</a> in the repo’s README, including <a href="https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa#ive-added-in-react-router-and-now-my-urls-dont-work-offline">steps to take</a> if you’re using <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-router</code> and need arbitrary URLs to work offline, as well as how you can add in <a href="https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa#im-using-cross-origin-apis-or-resources-and-they-arent-working-while-offline">runtime caching strategies</a> for calls to third party APIs and resources.</p><h1 id="beyond-create-react-app">Beyond create-react-app</h1><p>If you’re looking for examples of PWAs build with React that go a bit beyond what <code class="highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> offers—for instance, that take advantage of server-side rendering or are built on third-party APIs—there are a few examples I could recommend:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache/tree/master/app-shell-demo">iFixit PWA</a> (<a href="https://ifixit-pwa.appspot.com/">live deployment</a>)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/insin/react-hn">Hacker News PWA</a> (<a href="https://react-hn.appspot.com/">live deployment</a>)</li></ul></article></div></div></div><footer class="site-footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer-col-wrapper"><div class="footer-col footer-col-1"><ul class="social-media-list"><li><a href="mailto:blog@posnick.org">blog@posnick.org</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/"><span class="icon icon--github"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="#828282" d="M7.999,0.431c-4.285,0-7.76,3.474-7.76,7.761 c0,3.428,2.223,6.337,5.307,7.363c0.388,0.071,0.53-0.168,0.53-0.374c0-0.184-0.007-0.672-0.01-1.32 c-2.159,0.469-2.614-1.04-2.614-1.04c-0.353-0.896-0.862-1.135-0.862-1.135c-0.705-0.481,0.053-0.472,0.053-0.472 c0.779,0.055,1.189,0.8,1.189,0.8c0.692,1.186,1.816,0.843,2.258,0.645c0.071-0.502,0.271-0.843,0.493-1.037 C4.86,11.425,3.049,10.76,3.049,7.786c0-0.847,0.302-1.54,0.799-2.082C3.768,5.507,3.501,4.718,3.924,3.65 c0,0,0.652-0.209,2.134,0.796C6.677,4.273,7.34,4.187,8,4.184c0.659,0.003,1.323,0.089,1.943,0.261 c1.482-1.004,2.132-0.796,2.132-0.796c0.423,1.068,0.157,1.857,0.077,2.054c0.497,0.542,0.798,1.235,0.798,2.082 c0,2.981-1.814,3.637-3.543,3.829c0.279,0.24,0.527,0.713,0.527,1.437c0,1.037-0.01,1.874-0.01,2.129 c0,0.208,0.14,0.449,0.534,0.373c3.081-1.028,5.302-3.935,5.302-7.362C15.76,3.906,12.285,0.431,7.999,0.431z"/></svg> </span><span class="username">jeffposnick</span></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/"><span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill="#828282" d="M15.969,3.058c-0.586,0.26-1.217,0.436-1.878,0.515c0.675-0.405,1.194-1.045,1.438-1.809
